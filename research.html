        Research in our lab involves studies of magnetization reversal with microwave, heat, current,
        domain wall motions, etc. We study magnetic materials such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets.

        <h3>Spintronics</h3> <br>

        Spintronics is a new technology in solid-state devices which exploits the intrinsic spin of
        electrons and its associated magnetic moment in addition to its fundamental electronic
        charge.

        <h3>Magnetization Reversal</h3> <br>

        <img class="image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/1642749/images/8322638/half_magn.gif" alt="">

        Magnetization reversal is a crucial technology in memory devices. Achieving fast and
        energy-efficient magnetization reversal of high anisotropy materials has drawn much attention
        since it has potential application in non-volatile data storage devices and fast data processing.
        For high thermal stability and low error rate, high anisotropy materials are required in
        device application. But one of the challenging issues is to find out the way which can
        induce the fastest magnetization reversal with minimal energy consumption. Over the last two
        decades, many magnetization reversal methods has been investigated, such as by constant
        magnetic fields, by the microwave field of constant frequency, either with or without a
        polarized electric current and by spin-transfer torque (STT) or spin-orbit torque (SOT).
        However, all the means are suffering from their own limitations. For instance, in the case
        of external magnetic field, reversal time is longer and has scalability and field localization
        issues. In case of the constant microwave field driven magnetization reversal, the large field
        amplitude and the long reversal time are emerged as limitations. In the case of the STT-MRAM,
        the threshold current density is a large and thus, Joule heat which may lead the device
        malfunction durability and reliability issues. Moreover, there are several studies showing
        magnetization reversal induced by microwaves of time-dependent frequency.

        During his Ph.D., Dr. Md. Torikul Islam has demonstrated that the circularly polarized
        linear down-chirp microwave pulse (DCMP) (whose frequency linearly decreases with time
        from the initial frequency can drive fast magnetization reversal of uniaxial nanoparticles.
        The working principle of the above model is that the DCMP triggers stimulated microwave energy
        absorption (emission) by (from) the magnetization before (after) crossing the energy barrier.
        However, the efficiency of triggered microwave energy absorption or emission depends on how
        closely the frequency of chirp microwave pulse matches the magnetization precession frequency.
        In DCMP-driven case, the frequency linearly decreases from with time but, in fact, the
        decrement of magnetization precession frequency is not linear during magnetization reversal.
        So the frequency of DCMP only roughly matches the magnetization precession frequency. Thus,
        the DCMP triggers inefficient energy absorption or emission and the required microwave
        amplitude is still large.
        <br><br>

        Therefore, to achieve more efficient magnetization reversal, we have found a microwave
        pulse of proper time-dependent frequency that matches the intrinsic magnetization precession
        frequency better. In our recent study, we demonstrate that a cosine chirp microwave pulse
        (CCMP), defined as a microwave pulse whose frequency sweeps in a cosine function with time
        in first half-period of the microwave pulse, is capable of driving the fast and energy
        efficient magnetization reversal. This is because the frequency change of the CCMP matches
        the nonlinear frequency change of magnetization precession better than the DCMP. In addition,
        our study emphasizes how the shape anisotropy influences the required parameters of CCMP and
        how the Gilbert damping affects the magnetization reversal. We find that the increase of
        easy-plane shape anisotropy makes the magnetization reversal easier. The materials with
        larger damping are better for fast magnetization reversal. These investigations might be
        useful in device applications.
